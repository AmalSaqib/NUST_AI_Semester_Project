# NUST_AI_Semester_Project

For our AI semester project, I, along with 2 group members, used German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset to detect and differentiate traffic signs by using an image of each sign
as input.

In this repository you will find:
- THE PROJECT PROPOSAL to get an overview of the problem statement
- THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK with the code used
- THE MODEL which is the final model used after hypertuning a CNN model
- THE PROJECT ANALYSIS that elaborates the results
